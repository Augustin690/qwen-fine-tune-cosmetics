# Skincare Product Classification with Qwen2-VL-2B
This project implements a fine-tuned version of Qwen2-VL-2B for classifying skincare products into 14 categories using product images. The model achieves 50% accuracy, improving from 29.4% in zero-shot performance.

## Getting Started
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Set up environment variables:
"export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"
## Load the fine-tuned model:
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText

auto_processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("path/to/base-model")
auto_model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained("path/to/fine-tuned-model")

The processor will be the one of the base model, the model will be the fine-tuned model.
## Input wandb and HF credentials in the .env file

# Results
The fine-tuned model shows significant improvements:
Accuracy: 50.0% (+20.6%)
F1 Score: 51.0% (+15.0%)
Better handling of product categories with reduced "Unknown" classifications
